This project was prepared for a Intro to Data MOOC Challenge organized by Code First Girls and allowed me to become one of the three finalists invited to present their projects. The database was created using MySQL. Below you can find a couple of screenshots the presentation where I talk through the context and construction of the table in its original form. Full presentation you can find here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kNBsnCLuZWDs6f2mQSqH2i1qkItv6122pZkuvIicTiw/edit?usp=drive_link
